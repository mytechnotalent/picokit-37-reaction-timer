## Power

- LCD backpack VCC to 5 V (VBUS).
- RYLR998 VCC to 3.3 V.
- All grounds common.

## Breadboard

1. Seat the Pico 2 across the center channel.
2. Wire the three LEDs with their resistors to GP16, GP17, and GP18, cathodes
   to the ground rail.
3. Wire the button between GP15 and the ground rail.
4. Wire the LCD SDA to GP2 and SCL to GP3, VCC to 5 V.
5. Wire the RYLR998 TX to GP9 and RX to GP8, VCC to 3.3 V, GND common.
6. Connect the Debug Probe to SWCLK, SWDIO, and GND, and its UART to GP0/GP1.

## Gateway

- Connect the second RYLR998 to a USB serial adapter and the computer.
- On macOS the adapter appears as `/dev/cu.usbserial-A50285BI`.
